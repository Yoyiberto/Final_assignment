## Final Assignment for Capstone Project

In the following lines I will define some important aspects about the topic I am working to finish the final assignment.

In order to open new venues and get a sense of which ones are the most popular ones, I am going to compare some important cities. To do it, I am going to retrieve all the venues from the cities and get the most commun venues. 
This should give a sense that the cities that have similar venues are in a sense very similar cities. 
If some specific type of venue is succesful in a city and there's other city which is similar, it is very likely that the venue would be succesful in the other city.
Also, knowing which venues are most commun could give a hint of how much profitable are those venues.I am planning to plot a map with the most commun venue to see which part of the city is not crowded with that venue. This information should let us know which venue put and where in order to get the most profit from it.

The most difficult part might not be to use the algorithms, because we can get the result we want with really simple algorithms. Usign simple algorithms would mean that it would be computational less expensive and easier to understand for everyone. In this case, the data has to be found on the web and it might not be so easy to find complete information for all the neighborhoods. In this case ,to be sure I am going to use data from California, Toronto and Manhattan.
I will have to clean all the data and use dataframes to get the desired information. I will be necessary to learn to use an new algorith to get the coordinates of the neighborhoods, because the past methods did not work at all in my computer.
I am going to retrieve all the venues from Foursquare and show the maps using follium. I will use hot encoding to get all the venues in different categories and then sum the number of venues in each category.Then, I will plot the most commun venues of the cities in bar charts. Then I will compare the cities and decide which are similar to the others. Finally I am going to plot a map with only the most profitable venue and it would be easy to determine where it would be best to put one.
